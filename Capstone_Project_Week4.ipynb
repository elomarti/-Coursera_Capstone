    "For this project,  I will use the following data sources:\n",

    "3. Paris neighborhoods data obtained from the Wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrondissements_of_Paris)and we will use the geocoder package to get the coordinates of each postal code. It has to be noted that, in Paris, there are no boroughs, only neighborhoods which are called \"Arrondissements\" in french. As such, the \"Borough\" data will be added to the data set by copying the name of the neighborhood. Also, the postcodes are easily derived from the table in the Wikipedia page as the postcodes of each _arrondissement_ is constructed as follows: \n",
    "    - if the _arrondissement_ is number only one number: '7500' + number of the _arrondissement_\n",
    "    - if the _arrondissement_ is number is made of two numbers: '750' + number of the _arrondissement_"
