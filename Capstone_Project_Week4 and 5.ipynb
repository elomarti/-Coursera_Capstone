    "__Paris__: Paris is the capital and most populous city of France, with a population of 2,140,526 residents (official estimate, 1 January 2019) in an area of 105 square kilometres (41 square miles).\n",
    "Since the 17th century, Paris has been one of Europe's major centres of finance, diplomacy, commerce, fashion, science and the arts.\n",

    "\n",
    "__New York City__: New York City (NYC), also known as the City of New York or simply New York (NY), is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2018 population of 8,398,748 distributed over a land area of about 302.6 square miles (784 km2), New York is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. New York City has been described as the cultural, financial, and media capital of the world, and exerts a significant impact upon commerce, entertainment, research, technology, education, politics, tourism, art, fashion, and sports. \n",

    "__Toronto__: Toronto is the provincial capital of Ontario and the most populous city in Canada, with a population of 2,731,571 as of 2016. Current to 2016, the Toronto census metropolitan area (CMA), of which the majority is within the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), held a population of 5,928,040, making it Canada's most populous CMA.\n",

Paris neighborhoods data obtained from the Wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrondissements_of_Paris) and we will use the geocoder package to get the coordinates of each postal code. It has to be noted that, in Paris, there are no boroughs, only neighborhoods which are called \"Arrondissements\" in french. As such, the \"Borough\" data will be added to the data set by copying the name of the neighborhood. Also, the postcodes are easily derived from the table in the Wikipedia page as the postcodes of each _arrondissement_ is constructed as follows: \n",
    "    - if the _arrondissement_ is number only one number: '7500' + number of the _arrondissement_\n",
    "    - if the _arrondissement_ is number is made of two numbers: '750' + number of the _arrondissement_"

    "- Also hotels are more present in the most common venues in Paris compared to Toronto and NYC (which is in line with some recent rankings https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/most-visited-cities-euromonitor-2019/index.html where Paris appears to be before NYC (only two ranks above) and way above Toronto which did not make the list). \n",
    "- Even if NYC and Paris are both very food oriented, it has to be noted that food in NYC is more diverse. In Paris, most common venues are French Restaurants.\n",
    "- Bars are more common venues in Paris compared to Toronto and NYC\n"

    "One of the hardest part of this project was to determine the right k to be used in the k-mean algorithm. \n",
    "At first, I tried to use the shoulder methodology but this did not work as expected for the given datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "As such, I decided to use the silhouette score methodology which consists in identifying the peaks in the graph and then chose the appropriate k. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using this methodology, I decided to use the following ks: 4 for NYC and Toronto and 3 for Paris. \n",
    "\n",
    "It has to be noted that choosing the right k was not only based on the peaks in the graph but also on the reasonableness. Meaning that, for example, for  Paris, I could have chosen a higher k but I had to take into account that there are only 20 neighborhoods in Paris. \n",
    "As such, I chose the smallest number I found. Same goes for the other two cities. \n",
    "\n",
    "Had I chosen to look at NYC overall and not just the borough of Manhattan, I would probably have chosen a higher k than 4 if the peaks were the same."

    "In this study, I analyzed similarity and differences between three cities: NYC (reduced to the Borough of Manhattan), Toronto and Paris.\n",
    "I built a classification model to predict cluster neighborhoods in those three cities in order to make it easy to compare those based on venues (as referenced and detailed in Foursquare)\n",
    "These models can be useful in helping someone decide which city would be the better fit for them based on personal tests.\n",
    "For example, if you are into French food, you'd better live in Paris (that was kind of expected but one never knows...). \n",
    "If you like international cuisine, and Italian food particularly, you'd better go live in NYC. \n",
